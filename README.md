# Introduction
Misc system managing tools for myself. I wrote this document because I think
someone might need this, perhaps...

# Pre-requirement
* Unix like OS
* Bash / zsh
* GNU coreutils
* ....

# Functions
* cgrep: grep all c, h, asm files
* orz: orz...
* pygrep: grep all python files
* rbgrep: grep all ruby files, and this sucks as much as r\*\*\y itself.
* rpt: make a report today.
* today: date
* toush: touch a executable shell
* ....
